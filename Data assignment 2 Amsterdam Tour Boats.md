# Data assignment 2 Amsterdam Tour Boats
Note that this is far from done!

• How many of the canal boats currently in use are diesel/fossil fuel driven and how 

many boats are electrical driven? 

Only 1% of 10m+ boats are electric 

• Are there peak times for the canal boats? 

• Try to compare the energy use of the canal boats to some other activities in the city. 

Use canal boats more or less energy in relation to their carbon footprint compared to 

these other activities? 

The yearly energy demand for all 115 large-sized electric canal boats is 7340 MWh.  

 

• Would you consider it economically feasible? 

• How many support boats and vehicles are needed for the Paralympics event only. Quentin 

For races of 10km or less, or where the race is run over a circuit course such that individual escort boats are not appropriate, the Feeding Platform Judges will be located on the feeding platforms to supervise the activities on the platform and the feeding process. You need safety boats and rescue boats but no specific numbers are given anywhere.  

• If only clean energy can be used, how many solar panels or wind turbines are needed? 

• Is it possible to accommodate these facilities within the city? 

• Would their be any effect on the water quality if there are less/no canal boats using 

fossil fules?
