<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Paris is hosting the Paralympics in 2024. One of the events at the Paralympics is an open water
swimming event in the Seine (apparently the water is clean or so the French say). Since the City of Amsterdam thinks it is beter than Paris, they want to host an event before the Paralympics, snubbing the Parisians.</p>

<p>The idea is to host a 5km open water swimming event through the canals of Amsterdam. We were asked by the municipality of Amsterdam to advise on the feasibility of the event from the perspective of the safety of the partaking athletes from an environmental perspective. The event is going to be hosted in May.</p>

<h3 id="assignment-1">Assignment 1</h3>
<p>In the first assignment we take a first look at some of the aspects of the event and what data could be useful. More specifically, we will look into pollution levels, commercial water transport, sewage system overflow, etc.</p>

<p>You will find the first assignment <a href="./Assignment1.html">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="assignment-2">Assignment 2</h3>
<p>In this assignment on touring boats we have retrieved the number of canal boats that are currently active in the canals of Amsterdam. Furthermore, we looked into the peak times of canal boats in the city and where there presence is most notable. Lastly, we looked into the energy use of canal boats and the possibilities of electrification of the fleet of canal boats. Along with this some calculations were made to estimate the economic feasibility of thisÂ transition.</p>

<p>You will find the second assignment <a href="./Assignment2.html">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="assignment-3">Assignment 3</h3>
<p>In this housing assignment we calculated how much tourist tax the municipality of Amsterdam will receive during the swimming event for 30.000 visitors. We plotted the distribution of AirBnb locations over the neighbourhoods in Amsterdam. On top of this, we calculated in which street most AirBnB locations are located and we looked if the AirBnB locations per neighbourhood in the AirBnB data corresponded with the Basis Bestanden Gebied Amsterdam.</p>

<p>You will find the third assignment <a href="./Assignment3.html">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="assignment-4">Assignment 4</h3>
<p>For this exercise we chose a swimming route in Amsterdam for the swimming event. The headquarters is located on a suitable spot near the center of the route. We also looked into public transport connectivity for the start and end point of the route. The centrality was calculated and finally we looked at the cafes and restaurants near the finish line.</p>

<p>You will find the fourth assignment <a href="./Assignment4.html">here</a>.</p>
